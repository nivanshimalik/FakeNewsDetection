# FakeNewsDetection

Fake news detection using machine learning involves developing algorithms to identify and classify news articles as real or fake. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing news data, including text cleaning and normalization. Features are then extracted using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, and the text is processed with methods such as stemming. Machine learning models, like Logistic Regression is trained to discern patterns indicative of misinformation.
